# Major Bug Fixes Applied

## Problem 1: Piece Color and Capture Issues ✅ FIXED (MAJOR REFACTOR)

**Issue**: Multiple critical bugs with pieces that share the same Chinese characters (馬 for horse, 車 for chariot):
1. Pieces changing color when moved to opposite side of board
2. Captured pieces not being removed from board during same-piece captures
3. Color confusion in piece identification system

**Root Cause**: Using Chinese characters as piece identifiers caused ambiguity since both red and black pieces use identical characters for horses (馬) and chariots (車).

**Solution Applied - Complete Piece ID System Refactor**:
1. **Unique Piece IDs**: Replaced character-based system with unique identifiers
   - `red_chariot`, `black_chariot` instead of both using '車'
   - `red_horse`, `black_horse` instead of both using '馬'
   - All pieces now have unique IDs: `red_king`, `black_advisor`, etc.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - Internal representation: Unique piece IDs for game logic
   - Display representation: Traditional Chinese characters for UI
   - Added `getPieceDisplay()` function to convert IDs to characters

3. **Simplified Color Detection**:
   - `getPieceColorFromId()` function extracts color from piece ID
   - No more position-based color tracking needed
   - Eliminated complex piece color tracker system

4. **Robust Capture Logic**:
   - Captures now work correctly for all piece combinations
   - No more color mixing during same-piece captures
   - Clean piece removal from board

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/gameLogic.js` - Complete refactor with new piece ID system
- `src/components/ChessSquare.js` - Updated to display Chinese characters from IDs
- `src/components/ChessBoard.js` - Updated piece selection logic
- `src/utils/aiEngine.js` - Updated piece values and evaluation
- `src/context/GameContext.js` - Simplified state management

## Problem 2: No Check/Checkmate Detection ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Game continued even when a king was captured or in checkmate.

**Root Cause**: No check/checkmate logic implemented in game state management.

**Solution Applied**:
1. Added `isInCheck(board, kingColor)` function
2. Added `isCheckmate(board, playerColor)` function
3. Integrated check detection into move validation
4. Added game status tracking ('playing', 'check', 'red_wins', 'black_wins')
5. Updated UI to show check warnings and game over messages
6. Prevented moves when game is over

**New Functions Added**:
- `isInCheck()` - Detects if king is under attack
- `isCheckmate()` - Detects if player has no legal moves to escape check
- Enhanced game state management with status tracking

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/gameLogic.js` - Added check/checkmate detection
- `src/context/GameContext.js` - Integrated into game state
- `src/components/GameControls.js` - Added status display and warnings
- `src/components/ChessBoard.js` - Prevented moves when game over

## Additional Improvements

### Enhanced Game Status Display
- ✅ Real-time check warnings with red alerts
- ✅ Game over celebrations with winner announcement
- ✅ Visual status indicators in game controls
- ✅ Proper game flow management

### AI Integration Fixes
- ✅ AI now correctly identifies piece colors
- ✅ AI respects check/checkmate rules
- ✅ Game stops when AI achieves checkmate
- ✅ AI continues playing when opponent is in check (but not checkmate)

### User Experience Improvements
- ✅ Clear visual feedback for game states
- ✅ Prevented invalid interactions when game is over
- ✅ Proper piece selection based on current player
- ✅ Consistent color coding throughout the interface

## Testing Verification

Both major issues have been resolved:

1. **Piece Colors**: All pieces now display correct colors and can only be controlled by their respective players
2. **Game Ending**: Game properly detects check and checkmate, displays appropriate messages, and prevents further moves

The game now provides a complete and accurate Chinese Chess experience with proper rule enforcement and game state management.
