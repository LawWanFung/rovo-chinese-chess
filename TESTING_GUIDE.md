# AI Testing Guide

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. Setup and Launch
```bash
cd rovo-chinese-chess
npm install
npm start
```
Open browser to: http://localhost:3000

### 2. Basic AI Testing

#### Test AI Mode Activation
1. âœ… Click "vs AI" button in game controls
2. âœ… Verify mode switches from "Human vs Human" to "vs AI"
3. âœ… Check that AI difficulty dropdown appears
4. âœ… Confirm current player shows "ç´…æ–¹ (Red)" for human

#### Test AI Difficulty Levels
1. âœ… Select "Easy" - should respond quickly (~100-300ms)
2. âœ… Select "Medium" - balanced response time (~300-800ms)  
3. âœ… Select "Hard" - longer thinking time (~800-2000ms)
4. âœ… Verify difficulty changes are reflected in AI Status panel

#### Test AI Gameplay
1. âœ… Make a move as Red (human player)
2. âœ… Watch for "AI is thinking..." indicator
3. âœ… Verify AI makes a valid move as Black
4. âœ… Check move appears in move history
5. âœ… Confirm turn switches back to Red

### 3. Advanced Testing

#### Test AI Move Quality
- **Easy AI**: Should make reasonable but not perfect moves
- **Medium AI**: Should show tactical awareness, avoid obvious blunders
- **Hard AI**: Should play strategically, consider multiple moves ahead

#### Test Game Flow
1. âœ… Play several moves back and forth
2. âœ… Verify AI follows all Chinese Chess rules
3. âœ… Test piece captures work correctly
4. âœ… Check that invalid moves are prevented
5. âœ… Verify game state updates properly

#### Test UI/UX
1. âœ… Board becomes non-interactive during AI thinking
2. âœ… Loading spinner appears during AI calculation
3. âœ… AI Status panel updates in real-time
4. âœ… Move history tracks both human and AI moves
5. âœ… Game mode indicator shows correct status

### 4. Edge Case Testing

#### Test Game Reset
1. âœ… Click "New Game" during AI mode
2. âœ… Verify board resets to initial position
3. âœ… Check AI mode and difficulty are preserved
4. âœ… Confirm Red player starts first

#### Test Mode Switching
1. âœ… Switch from "vs AI" to "Human vs Human"
2. âœ… Verify AI components disappear
3. âœ… Switch back to "vs AI"
4. âœ… Check AI functionality resumes

#### Test Error Handling
1. âœ… Try rapid clicking during AI thinking
2. âœ… Attempt to select black pieces as human
3. âœ… Verify graceful handling of edge cases

### 5. Performance Testing

#### Response Times by Difficulty
- **Easy**: Target < 500ms
- **Medium**: Target < 1000ms
- **Hard**: Target < 2500ms

#### Memory Usage
- Monitor browser memory during extended play
- Check for memory leaks after multiple games
- Verify smooth performance on mobile devices

### 6. Browser Testing

Test in multiple browsers:
- âœ… Chrome/Chromium
- âœ… Firefox
- âœ… Safari
- âœ… Edge
- âœ… Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### 7. Expected AI Behaviors

#### Opening Play
- AI should develop pieces logically
- Avoid moving same piece multiple times early
- Control center and protect king

#### Mid-game
- Look for tactical opportunities
- Maintain piece coordination
- Respond to threats appropriately

#### Endgame
- Push for checkmate when ahead
- Defend accurately when behind
- Demonstrate basic endgame knowledge

### 8. Common Issues to Check

#### AI Not Responding
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify all files loaded correctly
- Ensure proper game state management

#### Invalid AI Moves
- Confirm move validation is working
- Check piece movement rules implementation
- Verify board state consistency

#### Performance Issues
- Monitor calculation times
- Check for infinite loops in AI logic
- Verify alpha-beta pruning is working

### 9. Success Criteria

The AI should demonstrate:
- âœ… Legal move generation
- âœ… Reasonable move selection
- âœ… Appropriate difficulty scaling
- âœ… Stable performance
- âœ… Good user experience
- âœ… Error-free operation

### 10. Reporting Issues

If you find any problems:
1. Note the specific steps to reproduce
2. Record browser and device information
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Document expected vs actual behavior
5. Include screenshots if helpful

## Automated Testing

For developers, run the built-in test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

This will run unit tests for:
- AI engine functionality
- Move generation
- Board evaluation
- Game logic validation

Happy testing! ðŸŽ®
